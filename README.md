Hi there! 👋 I'm **Anusha Udayakumar** — a data science enthusiast with an insatiable curiosity for understanding how things work.

I’m passionate about unraveling patterns in data, exploring the math and logic behind machine learning, and building intelligent systems that can make a real impact. Whether it’s forecasting trends, modeling behaviors, or solving complex problems through code — I thrive at the intersection of statistics, storytelling, and technology.

I love asking “why” — whether it's about user behavior, model outputs, or why that one feature improved performance by 20%.

Currently diving deeper into:
- Advanced AI/ML techniques and model interpretability
- Scalable data engineering pipelines
- Cloud ecosystems like AWS, GCP, and Azure

I enjoy collaborating on meaningful projects, especially those in data for good, education, or emerging tech.

Feel free to reach out:

- Portfolio: [anushaudayakumar.netlify.app](https://anushaudayakumar.netlify.app/)

✨ Fun Fact: I'm always up for spontaneous road trips and love discovering new cultures, people, and ideas — just like how I explore data.
