Hi, I’m **Anusha Udayakumar** — a data science professional passionate about transforming complex data into meaningful insights.

With a strong foundation in machine learning, statistics, and data engineering, I enjoy solving real-world problems through analytical thinking and scalable solutions. I’m particularly driven by the "why" behind the data — understanding patterns, behaviors, and systems at their core.

Currently exploring:
- Applied machine learning and AI for impact
- Scalable data pipelines and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP)
- Statistical modeling and data storytelling

I'm always open to collaborating on projects that bridge data, technology, and decision-making.
